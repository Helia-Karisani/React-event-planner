# React Event Planner 🗓️

This project is a React-based **Event Planner** web application created as part of my front-end learning journey.

## ✅ What I've Done So Far

- Initialized a React project and organized it under `src/`.
- Updated the initial component structure to support a multi-section event planning UI.
- Implemented the main layout in [`src/Components/EventPlanner.jsx`](src/Components/EventPlanner.jsx), including:
  - A welcome header and description section
  - A categorized event listing (Social, Entertainment, Community)
  - A dynamic features section
  - Testimonials section
  - Contact form with input fields
- Created and added a footer component in [`src/Components/Footer.jsx`](src/Components/Footer.jsx).

## 📁 Project Structure

All JSX source files are located under:
```

📂 src/
└── 📂 Components/
├── EventPlanner.jsx
├── EventPlanner.css
└── Footer.jsx

```

## 🚀 Upcoming

- Add backend integration for contact form
- Improve responsiveness and styling
- Deploy the app live
